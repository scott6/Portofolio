# Ary Pambudi – Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This space showcases a collection of my development work, with a strong focus on UI/UX design, front-end engineering, and practical problem-solving.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, but my passion for programming and design started in college. My final project involved building an IoT system that used sensors and microcontrollers to automate data collection and control. Since then, I’ve focused on blending engineering and coding to create **practical solutions** that genuinely help people in their work.

## 🎨 What I Do

- Craft intuitive UI/UX designs for modern web applications
- Build responsive front‑end interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSONC
- Develop custom UI components, editors, and interactive tools
- Design scalable, maintainable solutions tailored to real‑world workflows
- Translate complex requirements into simple, user‑friendly system designs
- Blend engineering logic and design thinking to create solutions that feel effortless to use
